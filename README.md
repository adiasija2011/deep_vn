# Deep VN

Deep VN is a project developed as part of an internship at the Wireless Systems Lab, IIIT Delhi. The project aims to simulate high-traffic Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) environments and implement machine learning models for traffic prediction and optimization.


## Installation

To run this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/adiasija2011/deep_vn.git
    cd deep_vn
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Set up SUMO:**
    - Follow the [SUMO installation guide](https://sumo.dlr.de/docs/Installing.html) to install SUMO on your system.


    ```

## Results

### Simulation
The simulator effectively models high-traffic V2X environments, providing a realistic testbed for evaluating various traffic scenarios and strategies.
